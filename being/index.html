    <p>Please explore this sound like you would a physical space:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Find an indoor space with enough room to move around in.</li>
      <li>
        The sound should be experienced amplified in a space, NOT through
        headphones.
      </li>
      <li>
        Play the sound through the loudest device that you have access to, as
        loudly as is comfortable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Explore how the smallest motion of your head or body may change the
        sound.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the sound concludes, continue to explore the space in silence.
        What has changed?
      </li>
    </ul>
