      Hello, and welcome to the first WIP for our Isolated Acts piece. As
      context, the experience you are about to have is just one piece part of a
      larger project. We are interested in creating a series of website-based
      “apps” that turn audience participation into an exploration of personal
      experience. If you were participating in the final version of our piece,
      you would have received a link to the app we’re about to show you through
      a text or an email that would provide additional context and structure to
      the experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      We ask that you use headphones for this experience if possible. The
      website is not recording your answers. We will set a timer for 10 minutes,
      and let you explore a draft of one app. When time is up, we’ll let you
      know via Zoom.
