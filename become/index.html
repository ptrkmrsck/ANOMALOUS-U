    <p>
      You are invited to listen to these THREE small snippets of audio at your
      own pace.
    </p>
    <p>WHILE YOU LISTEN:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Notice how adept your mind is at perceiving even the subtlest of
        changes.
      </li>
      <li>Actively try and imagine the source of these sounds.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ASK YOURSELF:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How does meaning change as the sound changes?</li>
      <li>When does the sound seem like it has fully come into focus?</li>
      <li>Where does sound end and meaning begin?</li>
    </ul>
