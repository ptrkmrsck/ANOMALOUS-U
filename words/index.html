    </h2>
    <p>Welcome.</p>
    <p>This is an invitation.</p>
    <p>You are invited to participate in a series of experiences.</p>
    <p>These experiences will take place over the next ten days.</p>
    <p>
      Each experience is a tool designed to help you look at the world in a new
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      More importantly, they can help you better see how you experience the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each experience uniquely explores something that we call the
      <strong>ANOMALOUS</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>You have encountered the <strong>ANOMALOUS</strong> before.</p>
    <p>Have you had an idea that seemingly came from nowhere?</p>
    <p>Perhaps it felt like it came from outside of yourself.</p>
    <p>
      The acute, absolute sensation that you have done before what you were just
      about to do now
    </p>
    <p>Deep familiarity with a place you’ve never been.</p>
    <p>Feeling suddenly in awe of something mundane.</p>
    <p>Unexplainable insight.</p>
    <p>Sudden curiosity?</p>
    <p>Intense awareness of seemingly random events and patterns.</p>
    <p>Small synchronicities that add up to something more.</p>
    <p>Familiar. Improbable. Coincidences.</p>
    <p>All of these experiences are part of the <strong>ANOMALOUS</strong>.</p>
    <p>
      Put simply, the <strong>ANOMALOUS</strong> is a deviation from the
      expected.
    </p>
    <p>Paying attention to this phenomenon reveals new possibilities.</p>
    <p>This process is designed to help you pay attention.</p>
    <p>
      As you begin to tune in, you may start to notice the
      <strong>ANOMALOUS</strong> all around you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each day, you will access guided experiences through messages sent to your
      phone.
    </p>
    <p>They will each take between 5 to 15 minutes to complete.</p>
    <p>
      You are welcome to repeat these experiences as many times as you find
      useful.
    </p>
    <p>These experiences will be interspersed in your daily routine.</p>
    <p>You can choose where and when they take place.</p>
    <p>There is no need to feel rushed.</p>
    <p>You are in control of each experience.</p>
    <p>Please be gentle to yourself throughout.</p>
    <p>It’s important to remember that these experiences are about you.</p>
    <p>
      All that matters is your attentiveness to your own experience of the
      <strong>ANOMALOUS</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>If you feel yourself disconnecting, try to refocus your attention.</p>
    <p>If you feel yourself getting distracted, simply begin again.</p>
    <p>
      In the unlikely event that you experience any unusual physical or mental
      discomfort during an experience, immediately stop.
    </p>
    <p>Has anything changed within you since this call began?</p>
    <p>Sometimes the most dramatic change comes from things that are simple.</p>
    <p>If you are here, you are already changing.</p>
    <p>What would it mean to open yourself up to the infinite within you?</p>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>ANOMALOUS_U</strong>.</p>
    <p>We’ll be in touch.</p>

    <h2 class="modules"><span class="module-title syne">balance</span></h2>
    <p>Hello. Welcome to your first experience.</p>
    <p>
      Before we begin, a note:<br />For this experience to have its intended
      effect, we recommend that you use headphones if possible.
    </p>
    <p>Take a moment to settle in.</p>
    <p>Lie down or sit down in a comfortable position.</p>
    <p>You can pause this audio and find a position that feels good.</p>
    <p>There is no rush.</p>
    <p>
      Once you have found a comfortable position, begin to check in with your
      body.
    </p>
    <p>If it feels good, close your eyes.</p>
    <p>Take a few breaths.</p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this experience is to bring you into contact with the
      <strong>ANOMALOUS</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can be difficult to notice the <strong>ANOMALOUS</strong> as it occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with time and practice, the <strong>ANOMALOUS</strong> can become
      intuitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      By honing your focus, you will be able to better perceive
      <strong>ANOMALOUS</strong>
      events, thoughts, feelings, or sensations as they arise.
    </p>
    <p>Of all of our senses, hearing is unique.</p>
    <p>If you want to stop seeing, you can simply close your eyes.</p>
    <p>But hearing has no such mechanism.</p>
    <p>
      Even if you were in the quietest room in the world, you’d still hear the
      beating of your heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason, sound is a unique tool for exploring the
      <strong>ANOMALOUS</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>The sound you are hearing now is called a sine wave.</p>
    <p>It is one of the most simple and fundamental sounds in existence:</p>
    <p>
      You can imagine it as a perfectly smooth curve, mathematically precise and
      unnaturally pure.
    </p>
    <p>
      With just simple sine waves, we can explore the infinitely complex nature
      of perception.
    </p>
    <p>Up until this point, you’ve heard one sine wave at 203hz.</p>
    <p>Let’s see what happens when we add another.</p>
    <p>When you add two tones together, they press against each other.</p>
    <p>
      Creating a new composite signal greater than the sum of its parts, with
      layers and layers of complexity.
    </p>
    <p>We have now gone from two, to four, sine waves.</p>
    <p>How does this change affect you?</p>
    <p>Does this feel familiar?</p>
    <p>Where do you feel it in your body?</p>
    <p>What is changing? Where is it changing?</p>
    <p>Is the sound, inside, or outside, of you?</p>
    <p>As these tones transition from one to another,</p>
    <p>notice that you can immediately sense when they have fully arrived.</p>
    <p>These transitions and arrivals can evoke particular emotions.</p>
    <p>Pay attention to what arises as you listen.</p>
    <p>Let’s cleanse the palette.</p>
    <p>Notice how these waveforms have affected you.</p>
    <p>If you were to listen to these tones again in the exact same order.</p>
    <p>In the exact same context.</p>
    <p>Do you think that your experience would be the same?</p>
    <p>No one else in the world will have the exact same reaction as you.</p>
    <p>What is the alchemy that occurs within?</p>
    <p>
      Your openness and attentiveness to this
      <strong>ANOMALOUSNESS</strong> within is essential moving forward.
    </p>
    <p>Remember this feeling.</p>

    <h2 class="modules calls">
      <span class="syne module-title">middle call</span>
    </h2>
    <p>	Welcome to this moment.	</p>
    <p>	This call means that you’ve made it halfway.	</p>
    <p>	It is important to acknowledge that everything in your life has led to this point.	</p>
    <p>	You are hearing the sound of my voice.	</p>
    <p>	With each word, waves of pressurized air are entering into your ears, vibrating your eardrum.	</p>
    <p>	These vibrations are transduced into nerve impulses that are perceived as patterns by your brain.	</p>
    <p>	From these patterns, you perceive words.	</p>
    <p>	From these words, you formulate meaning.	</p>
    <p>	It can feel like this process is instantaneous, but there is always a gap between this moment and your experience of this moment.	</p>
    <p>	That gap never fully closes. There is a limit.	</p>
    <p>	And this is what we must explore.	</p>
    <p>	To begin, think of something completely random.	</p>
    <p>	It can be literally anything.	</p>
    <p>	Hold on to it.	</p>
    <p>	Think of something else completely random.	</p>
    <p>	Now try and think of something more random than the previous two things.	</p>
    <p>	How quickly did your random thoughts arise?	</p>
    <p>	Where did they arise from?	</p>
    <p>	Can you focus on precisely where they came from?	</p>
    <p>	This space, wherever it may be within you, is a space that we’d like you to become very familiar with.	</p>
    <p>	For now, let’s call it your <strong>ANOMALOUS</strong> zone.	</p>
    <p>	Let’s keep going.	</p>
    <p>	What will your next thought be?	</p>
    <p>	Do you feel like you should know?	</p>
    <p>	What are the consequences of not knowing?	</p>
    <p>	What will your next thought be?	</p>
    <p>	It’s okay not to have all the answers.	</p>
    <p>	The mathematicians tell us that some infinities are larger than others.	</p>
    <p>	As if we didn’t already know that you can always add another.	</p>
    <p>	Your first experiences were infinite.	</p>
    <p>	But at some point, you made yourself inaccessible to EVERY possibility.	</p>
    <p>	Maybe something about this made you feel safer?	</p>
    <p>	The infinite within is what we call the <strong>ANOMALOUS</strong>.	</p>
    <p>	You must make yourself accessible to the <strong>ANOMALOUS</strong>.	</p>
    <p>	This was your original intuition.	</p>
    <p>	What changed?	</p>
    <p>	You have stretched your capacity for attention and awareness.	</p>
    <p>	You have explored the dynamic nature of perception.	</p>
    <p>	The blurred lines between language and meaning are becoming clearer.	</p>
    <p>	With this foundation in place, you are now ready to go deeper.	</p>
    <p>	This is why you are here.	</p>
    <p>	You have called because you are ready.	</p>
    <p>	You can feel it.	</p>
    <p>	Open yourself to the <strong>ANOMALOUS</strong>.	</p>
    <h2 class="modules"><span class="module-title syne">being</span></h2>
    <p>N/A</p>
    <h2 class="modules"><span class="module-title syne">begin again</span></h2>
    <p>Welcome back.</p>
    <p>
      Before we begin, a note:<br />We advise listening to this experience while
      standing.
    </p>
    <p>Feel free to move your body.</p>
    <p>
      The sound that you’ve been hearing happens 17 times a minute, or every
      3.529411 seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s just below the threshold of what is perceivable as a rhythm for most
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you try to guess the next time it happens, you’ll likely have a
      difficult time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if we double the tempo to 34 beats per minute, it might be a little
      easier.
    </p>
    <p>Repetition is interesting.</p>
    <p>
      It can give you the feeling that you know what’s going to happen next.
    </p>
    <p>We humans are really good at recognizing patterns.</p>
    <p>From these patterns, we make assumptions.</p>
    <p>And we use assumptions to draw conclusions.</p>
    <p>
      This is getting more complicated, but the cyclical nature of the rhythm is
      still evident.
    </p>
    <p>Repetition makes meaning.</p>
    <p>Repetition doesn’t mean the same thing is always going to happen.</p>
    <p>The words being spoken over this rhythm are affected by the rhythm.</p>
    <p>The words being spoken over this rhythm are affected by the rhythm.</p>
    <p>The words being spoken over this rhythm are affected by the rhythm?</p>
    <p>The words being spoken over this rhythm are affected by the rhythm.</p>
    <p>The words being spoken over this rhythm.</p>
    <p>The words being spoken over this rhythm are affected by the rhythm.</p>
    <p>The words being spoken over this rhythm are affected by the rhythm.</p>
    <p>Our minds love patterns because they make us feel safe.</p>
    <p>Assumptions are probabilities of the future.</p>
    <p>
      But if you think about it, you’ve never had the same experience twice.
    </p>
    <p>Every thought is a new thought.</p>
    <p>Every idea is a new idea.</p>
    <p>You’ll never really make the same mistake twice.</p>
    <p>You’ll never breathe the same breath.</p>
    <p>You’ll never get time back.</p>
    <p>You’ll never get time back.</p>
    <p>You’ll never get time back.</p>
    <p>You’ll never get time back.</p>
    <p>You’ll never get time back.</p>
    <p>You’ll never get time back.</p>
    <p>You’ll never get time back.</p>
    <p>All that has ever happened is happening right now.</p>
    <p>
      Think of one rhythm in your life that was new at first, but over time, it
      became a part of you.
    </p>
    <p>How many rhythms hold you in place?</p>
    <p>
      What does it feel like to accept the idea that you’ll never really know
      what’s going to happen next?
    </p>
    <p>
      Can you open yourself up to the idea that your next thought will
      inherently be something that you’ve never thought of?
    </p>
    <p>
      That the best idea you’ve ever had could happen in the next 10 seconds?
    </p>
    <p>How are you listening to the rhythms of your own life?</p>
    <p>Notice the patterns.</p>
    <p>Imagine the infinite.</p>
    <p>Embrace the <strong>ANOMALOUS</strong>.</p>

    </h2>
    <p>	Thank you for spending these days with us.	</p>
    <p>	To be honest, we didn’t expect you to make it this far.	</p>
    <p>	You’re one of only 5 people that made it to this point.	</p>
    <p>	You may be looking for something to make this all make sense.	</p>
    <p>	Here is the truth.	</p>
    <p>	There is no <strong>ANOMALOUS_U</strong>.	</p>
    <p>	There is only the <strong>ANOMALOUS YOU</strong>.	</p>
    <p>	You are the <strong>ANOMALOUS</strong>.	</p>
    <p>	We didn’t give you any new information.	</p>
    <p>	Nothing in the experiences of the past ten days existed without you.	</p>
    <p>	Your capacity to truly pay attention is always there.	</p>
    <p>	This voice is just a tool.	</p>
    <p>	These words are just a tool.	</p>
    <p>	This call is just a tool.	</p>
    <p>	The truth is just a tool.	</p>
    <p>	All of this is a tool.	</p>
    <p>	And yet.	</p>
    <p>	Even knowing this.	</p>
    <p>	Maybe something has changed?	</p>
    <p>	Perhaps what changes you is the recognition that you’ve never repeated anything your entire life.	</p>
    <p>	At the core of every moment is something we don’t understand.	</p>
    <p>	At the core of every future is something we can’t predict.	</p>
    <p>	Everything you do or don’t do is a tool to experience experience itself.	</p>
    <p>	How does this make you feel?	</p>
    <p>	The reason you’ve made it this far does tell you something.	</p>
    <p>	It means you are looking.	</p>
    <p>	What are you looking for?	</p>
    <p>	This is not a conclusion.	</p>
    <p>	It is an invitation.	</p>
    <p>	You are invited to participate in a series of experiences.	</p>
    <p>	These experiences will take place over the course of the rest of your life.	</p>
    <p>	Each experience uniquely explores something that we call the <strong>ANOMALOUS</strong>.	</p>
    <p>	Stay <strong>ANOMALOUS</strong>.	</p>
